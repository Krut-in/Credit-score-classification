# Credit Score Classification

* Created various machine learning models using credit-related information to predict multi-class outcomes.
* Performed Data Cleaning by correcting the incorrect data values using mean and mode techniques and removed outliers by
performing data engineering, resulting in a 15% improvement in the accuracy of models.
* Executed diverse Machine Learning models (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K Means
Clustering), achieving a peak of 98% accuracy with the Random Forest Classifier after tweaking hyperparameters.

Under the coursework of CS513-Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, following group project was created.
